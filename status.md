Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Since both of us have been away from campus since the proposal until Sunday, we haven't progressed too far in the project as of yet, although we have made some progress
on developing the lightcurve-analyzing functionality. We hope (as we both have some urgent projects this week) to kick it
into high gear on Friday and afterwards, as our obligations after then are almost entirely towards CS50.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Most of the project still has is being worked on, but this is primarily due to our being away from campus and current projects occupying our schedule
this week (much as we would have liked to have made substantial progress already). Specifically, we must still complete the machine learning model
for detecting lightcurves before developing a strong web application to display these results.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Not too many as of yet, but we will certainly be in touch with the TFs should we need have any questions in the coming weeks!
